Q1: the output is 
<__main__.Dog object at 0x0000012B72DA7FD0>
Scout
2
The first is for the print of the object dog we created, the second is when we fetch
its name from memory and the third its age from memory
Q2: 
Breed is encapsulated so we cant access it directly like the other without a helper

Q3: 
skippy = Dog("Skippy",4,"Rotweiler")
skippy.define_buddy(scout)
scout.buddy.description()
