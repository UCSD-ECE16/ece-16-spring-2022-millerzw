It becomes noisy again due to the smoothing not being perfect curves and so the 
    derivative will jump around in slope
If the sample frequency was 120Hz the max would be 60. We would need 20Hz at least
    to see a 0-10Hz bandwidth

Here, we can see the benefit to checking that we are able to sample and write
