**Tutorial_python_basics** :
    The most important takeaway for me from this, is that you cannot change 
strings once they are created. THs tutorial was really meant to show us the 
rules of the python language more than anything, about how you can mix 
datatypes in lists and what you can and cant do to edit lists, etc.

**Tutorial_numpy** :
    We had tasks to do in the numpy tutorial as explained below.
**Task_1** : Here we just subtracted an int from the array which subtracts
            that constant from every element

**Task_2** : This was possible by indexing out parts of the rows and using
            vstack to stack out the sections vertically

**Task_3** : I used hstack to horizontally duplicate the numbers then called
            vstack on the already hstacked aray to get a height of 4

**Task_4** : This was done by simply using arange with the start and end+1
            positions and passing in the correct spacing

**Task_5** : This is different from arange because you give it the start and
            end and it handles giving an even spacing between the points

**Task_6** : First I hand solved what the array would look like then broke it
            into sections, the bottom row was  4231 which I realized was 
            accomplished by an arange and then switching of two infdexes
            i noticed the top right 2x2 quadrant was acheivable by making
            a 2x2 ones matrix and multiplying the right column by 2. Lastly
            I had to deal with the top left two numbers which I realized would
            probably be beter harcoded, but used an arange to stay within the
            guidelines of the problem. Combining all these sections into the 
            zeros matrix gave the proper result.

**Task_7** : Here I acheived the task by splitting the string into an array 
            using the .split() command and then assigned array7 to that
            .split(). Then I could just run a 99x for loop that woud stack
            one row per loop to get a 100x4 array
