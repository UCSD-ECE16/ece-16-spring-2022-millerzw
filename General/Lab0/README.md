Lab 0 showed us how to set up git from our machine to github. Personally,
I set up my git connections through pycharm and vscode as it is more familiar
to me, and I've always felt that it is a smoother experience that way.

Secondary, we went over how to use the Markdown language for our file as well
and the different formatting associated with doing so> We were shown comments,
headers, break points, integrated python code, and how to include pictures and 
gifs as well.

The Challenge 1 expected us to pick out a group of interest and analyze 
some task that they perform, and questions that could be asked related to
said task. This looks to prime us for the first step of the Design process 
where we would Define a Problem.
