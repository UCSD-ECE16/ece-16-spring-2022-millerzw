1) Identify a user of interest
> Firefighters
2) Identify the task they perform
> They must put out fires
3) Start to ask questions pertaining to the task that would highlight
potential problems
> How does one prevent themselves from getting burned?
> 
> How do these protective measures impact performance of the user?
> 
> In what ways have the protective measures improved through time?
4) Look for answers to your questions(browse online, ask people who fall into
 the category of the person,etc.)
> The firefighters use turnout jackets consisting of fabrics like Nomex,
> Aramid, and/or kevlar to protect from the heat and chemicals. Underneath
> this they wear a moisture barrier that insulates the suit and provides
> extra thermal protection. The inner layer acts as a thermal barrier that
> wicks moisture outside the suit for user comfort. They also use helmets
> of materials that both require protection from falling objects, but still
> resist residual heat from the flames.
> 
> These garments are heavy and can weigh upwards of 20lbs each. This can
> lead more easily to fatigue on the wearer due to the added weight in 
> high activity scenarios. These suits also lead to potential for the 
> wearer to overheat more easily than a typical work outfit due to their
> insulation. The total weight of the gear exceeds 70 lbs which is a lot
> of stress on the body, and greatly inhibits mobility for the average
> wearer.
> 
> Improvements have been made over the years to lighten the fabrics used 
> while still keeping the protective properties of them. Masks have also
> seen a big improvement as they now protect against more harmful gasses
> such as Carbon Monoxide. The external tools that the firefighters used 
> have also become more improved/reliable with modern tools such as drills
> keeping their usability but being in a smaller form factor. Helmets are 
> another piece of equipment that have drastically improved: at one time
> they were even made of aluminum to try to disperse heat but gave a 
> dangerous outcome.
5) Formulate the problem statement as best as you can based on the previous
four steps
> The function of the garments that firefighters use must be at the forefront
> od fesign, rather than an excessive need for lightweight materials that cost
> much more and often do not make enough of a difference to the overall weight
> load that these firefighters must deal with
